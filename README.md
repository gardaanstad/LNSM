# Lille norske spr√•kmodell

This is my attempt to implement a fully functional Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch in Python using PyTorch. It's trained on publically available Norwegian corpuses.

Project structure:
- [data](data): Parsing text and creating datasets to train on
- [model](model): Creating the model
- [training](training): Training the model
- [tokenizer](tokenizer): Tokenization
- [config.py](files/config.py): Hyperparameters
